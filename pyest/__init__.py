MarkovPy --- Easy Markov chain Monte Carlo

Author: Daniel Foreman-Mackey

Description: This is an extensible, pure-Python implementation of Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) curve fitting. The calling syntax is designed to
be like scipy.optimize so that it can (almost) be a drop in replacement.

Usage: The most basic usage is by the `mcfit` function but for more complete
control, the user should instantiate an `EnsembleSampler` object and
interact directly with the sampler.
